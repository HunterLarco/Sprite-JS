Sprite.js
========

#### HTML5 Canvas Sprite API ####
The idea behind the Sprite API is to create a simple, easy to use library for creating canvas based applications and games. It essentially brings the DOM to the canvas by allowing for mouse events while at the same time retaining the integrity and diversity of the canvas.

### Usage ###
